# Java Subject Assignments

Project for a university subject that taught Java. Based on the game of Nim, which allows two players or one player versus the system. Allows users to be saved with their relevant score and ranking. Scores and rankings are outputted into a .text file after program is closed and then read upon starting the program again. Also employs the use of an AIplayer, who utilises the Nim winning strategy.
