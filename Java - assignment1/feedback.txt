/**
 * The Nimsys program implements the mathematical strategy game of Nim. Players
 * take turns removing stones from a total that is set at the
 * beginning of the game. The number of stones that the player removes must be less than
 * the upper bound value set at the beginning of the game. The player that avoids being the one
 * to remove the last stone is declared the winner.
